# docker-klondike
This is a docker project based upon https://bitbucket.org/tmuskal/docker-klondike which is running https://github.com/themotleyfool/Klondike to cache Nuget packages.

I was looking for a way to cache Nuget to allow building https://github.com/aspnet/aspnet-docker without the need to download Nuget packages everytime when executing `dnu restore`
